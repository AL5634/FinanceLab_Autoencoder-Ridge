#Notes the difference
This version implements more stabilization concerns, which may result in significant lower backtesting results compared to the RAF628 Week 11 class presentation.Each training iteration of the autoencoder may produce different results.
#Technical Components
Autoencoder for factor extraction,Ridge regression for factor selection, GARCH models for risk control, Backtest analysis
#Training time
when epoch is 5, the trainning time around 1-3 hours, when the epoch is 50, the training time is around 3-6 hours
